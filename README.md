## Machine Learning Project: Prediction of Rheumatoid Arthritis using DNA Methylation Data


## Project Oveview

Our project aims to predict Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) by analyzing DNA methylation datasets using advanced machine learning techniques. RA, a complex autoimmune disease, affects millions globally with chronic inflammation and joint damage. Leveraging cutting-edge algorithms, we'll uncover intricate patterns in DNA methylation, a key epigenetic factor in RA.

We'll explore high-dimensional genomic data, focusing on epigenetic changes linked to RA onset and progression. Using techniques like support vector machines and decision tree, we'll develop predictive models to detect subtle molecular signatures indicative of RA severity and susceptibility.

Our approach includes feature selection to identify informative DNA methylation markers, deepening our understanding of RA's biological mechanisms. Through rigorous cross-validation, we'll build robust models for accurate RA onset and progression forecasts.


### Data Sources
Genome-wide DNA methylation data extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). Samples, categorized as Rheumatoid arthritis patients or normal controls, provide the basis for analysis [Download here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse428610.
